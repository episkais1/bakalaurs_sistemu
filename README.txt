The bachelorâ€™s thesis investigates and compares various machine learning 
algorithms to assess their effectiveness in developing movie recommendation systems, 
which are essential for providing a personalized user experience on digital platforms. 
The objective of the thesis is to systematically evaluate the suitability of these 
algorithms based on their performance and accuracy to determine the most effective 
solutions for improving recommendation quality. In the experimental study, using 
Python, Scikit-Learn, and other libraries along with the MovieLens 1M dataset, the 
performance of different algorithms is analyzed. Results are evaluated using accuracy 
metrics MAE and RMSE, providing guidelines for choosing more efficient algorithms 
for movie streaming platforms and highlighting the advantages of matrix factorization 
methods for processing large volumes of data.
